  The dataset contains different information of complaints that customers have made about a multiple products and
  services in the financial sector, such us Credit Reports, Student Loans, Money Transfer, etc. The date of each
  complaint ranges from November 2011 to May 2019. The dataset has been modified to be used for text generation.
  We have added a structured JSON field that contains a company generated response to the raised complaint. The idea
  is to fine-tune an LLM to generate this output JSON field.
