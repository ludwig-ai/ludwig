            It's rare to see any performance gains from choosing
            a different bias initialization. Some practitioners like to use a small
            constant value such as 0.01 for all biases to ensure that all ReLU units
            are activated in the beginning and have some effect on the gradient. However,
            it's still an open question as to whether this provides consistent improvement.

SequenceGeneratorDecoder:

        short_description:
            Generates a sequence by sampling from the model.
        long_description:
            The generator decoder is a (potentially empty) stack of fully connected layers, followed by an
            RNN that generates outputs feeding on its own previous predictions and generates a tensor of
            size `b x s' x c`, where `b` is the batch size, `s'` is the length of the generated sequence and
            `c` is the number of classes, followed by a softmax_cross_entropy. During training teacher
            forcing is adopted, meaning the list of targets is provided as both inputs and outputs (shifted
            by 1), while at evaluation time greedy decoding (generating one token at a time and feeding it
            as input for the next step) is performed by beam search, using a beam of 1 by default. In
            general a generator expects a `b x h` shaped input tensor, where `h` is a hidden dimension. The
            `h` vectors are (after an optional stack of fully connected layers) fed into the rnn generator.
            One exception is when the generator uses attention, as in that case the expected size of the
            input tensor is `b x s x h`, which is the output of a sequence, text or time series input
            feature without reduced outputs or the output of a sequence-based combiner. If a `b x h` input
            is provided to a generator decoder using an RNN with attention instead, an error will be raised
            during model building.

    num_layers:
        default_value_reasoning:
            The ideal number of layers depends on the data and
            task. For many data types, one layer is sufficient.
        description_implications:
            Increasing the number of layers may improve model
            performance for longer sequences or more complex tasks.

        suggested_values_reasoning:
            Increasing the number of layers may improve encoder
            performance.  However, more layers will increase training time and may
            cause overfitting.  Small numbers of layers usually work best.

SequenceTaggerDecoder:
    type:
        short_description:
            Used for classifying each element of an input sequence.
        long_description:
            The tagger decoder is a (potentially empty) stack of fully connected layers,
            followed by a projection into a tensor of size `b x s x c`, where `b` is the batch size,
            `s` is the length of the sequence and `c` is the number of classes, followed by a
            softmax_cross_entropy. This decoder requires its input to be shaped as `b x s x h`, where `h` is
            a hidden dimension, which is the output of a sequence, text or time series input feature without
            reduced outputs or the output of a sequence-based combiner. If a `b x h` input is provided
            instead, an error will be raised during model building.

        description_implications:
            Increasing the embedding size may cause the model
            to train more slowly, but the higher dimensionality can also improve overall
            quality.
