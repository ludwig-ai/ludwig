oversample_minority:
    default_value_reasoning:
        We do not want to randomly oversample by default since
        this is a strategy to deal with imbalanced datasets, but can cause issues
        if not implemented correctly.
    description_implications:
        The higher the value you choose gets to 1, the closer
        you will be to having an equal imbalance ratio (i.e. 1:1 positive to negative
        class), however this can lead to problems of overfitting when oversampling
        is used too liberally. As a rule of thumb, starting oversampling with a very
        conservative approach and increasing in small incremements is probably the
        best way to improve your model without experiencing model overfitting.

        This parameter is one of many strategies to combat issues with
        class imbalance, though it is not a cure all. Oversampling too much can cause
        overfitting which can adversely affect your model so use with caution.

sample_ratio:
    default_value_reasoning:
        The default value is 1.0 because we do not want to shrink
        the dataset by default. In the rare occurences when you do want to downsample
        the entire dataset, this parameter is available, however it is not enabled
        by default, hence a default value of 1.0
    description_implications:
        Decreases the amount of data you are inputting into

        Most of the dataset should be used for training, with
        some portion heldout for validation and testing.
    description_implications:
        "In machine learning, data splitting is typically done
        to avoid overfitting. That is an instance where a machine learning model fits
        its training data too well and fails to reliably fit additional data.


        The training set is the portion of data used to train the model. The model
        should observe and learn from the training set, optimizing any of its parameters.


        The dev set is a data set of examples used to change learning process parameters.
        It is also called the cross-validation or model validation set. This set of
        data has the goal of ranking the model's accuracy and can help with model
        selection.


        The testing set is the portion of data that is tested in the final model and
        is compared against the previous sets of data. The testing set acts as an
        evaluation of the final mode and algorithm."

        By default, Ludwig looks for a column named split (case-sensitive) which is
        expected to consist of 3 possible values that correspond to different datasets:


        0: train

        1: validation

        2: test

        If the data does not contain the split column, then data is randomly split
        based on splitting percentages, defined by split_probabilities.


        If force_split is true, the the split column in the dataset is ignored and
        the dataset is randomly split based on splitting percentages, defined by split_probabilities."

stratify:
    default_value_reasoning:
        The default is set to None since we do not want to stratify

        but one example is that our data set may not even have a categorical feature
        to stratify on.

        Specifically for LLMs. This is the maximum number of tokens going into the model's forward pass during training. Sequences will be truncated to this length after merging the tokens from the input with tokens from the target. If not set, the total length of the merged input and target token sequences will be used.
