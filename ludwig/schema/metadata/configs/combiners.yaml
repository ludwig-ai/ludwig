            The method you choose to initialize layer weights
            during training can have a big impact on performance as well as the reproducibility
            of your final model between runs. As an example, if you were to randomly
            initialize weights you would risk non-reproducibility (and possibly general
            training performance), but sticking with constant values for initialization
            might significantly increase the time needed for model convergence. Generally,
            choosing one of the probabilistic approaches strikes a balance between
            the two extremes, and the literature kicked off by the landmark [*Xavier

            The method you choose to initialize layer weights
            during training can have a big impact on performance as well as the reproducibility
            of your final model between runs. As an example, if you were to randomly
            initialize weights you would risk non-reproducibility (and possibly general
            training performance), but sticking with constant values for initialization
            might significantly increase the time needed for model convergence. Generally,
            choosing one of the probabilistic approaches strikes a balance between
            the two extremes, and the literature kicked off by the landmark [*Xavier

            The method you choose to initialize layer weights
            during training can have a big impact on performance as well as the reproducibility
            of your final model between runs. As an example, if you were to randomly
            initialize weights you would risk non-reproducibility (and possibly general
            training performance), but sticking with constant values for initialization
            might significantly increase the time needed for model convergence. Generally,
            choosing one of the probabilistic approaches strikes a balance between
            the two extremes, and the literature kicked off by the landmark [*Xavier

        description_implications:
            Virtual Batch Normalization is a normalization method
            that extends batch normalization. Regular batch normalization causes the
            output of a neural network for an input example  to be highly dependent
            on several other inputs  in the same minibatch. To avoid this problem
            in virtual batch normalization (VBN), each example is normalized based
            on the statistics collected on a reference batch of examples that are
            chosen once and fixed at the start of training, and on itself. The reference
            batch is normalized using only its own statistics. VBN is computationally
            expensive because it requires running forward propagation on two minibatches
            of data, so the authors use it only in the generator network. A higher
            virtual batch size could improve normalization, but it also causes training
            to run slower since each batch will be sampled multiple times.

            during training can have a big impact on performance as well as the reproducibility

            might significantly increase the time needed for model convergence. Generally,
