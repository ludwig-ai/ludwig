            description_implications:
                Normalization helps stabilize the learning process
                and can have a regularizing effect that can help with generalization.
                It's often suggested that with normalization, you can use a higher
                learning rate.

        normalization:
            default_value_reasoning:
                Z-score normalization helps improve the training stability and convergence
                of neural networks by rescaling the numeric input features to have a mean
                of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, reducing the variability and distribution
                of the data. This improves neural network training.
            description_implications:
                The goal of normalization is to transform features
                to be on a similar scale. Normalization can be a form of feature smoothing
                that improves the performance and training stability of the model.
                Normalizations may result in different effects on the semantics of
                your number features. The best normalization technique is one that
                empirically works well, so try new ideas if you think they'll work
                well on your feature distribution.

                be truncated to this length.
            description_implications:
                A larger sequence length keeps more information
                from the data, but also makes it more computationally expensive (more
                memory and longer training time). A smaller sequence length keeps
                less information from the data, but also makes it less computationally
                expensive (less memory and shorter training time).

                If there are more than 10000 unique categories

            description_implications:
                A smaller number will reduce the vocabulary,
                making the embedding matrix smaller and reduce the memory footprint,
                but will also collapse more tokens into the rare one, so the model
                may perform worse when rare tokens appear in the data

        padding:
            default_value_reasoning:
                We usually want to add padding to the end of
                a text sequence to fill in any remaining space as opposed to the beggining
                so we set the default to right.
            description_implications:
                If you pad to the left, the encoded vector will
                have leading padding tokens as opposed to trailing padding tokens.
                This could matter based on the type of text input you are expecting.

                the text on whitespace and punctuation characters. For example: The
                text `''hello world!isn''t this great?''` would be transformed to
                `[''hello'', ''world'', ''!'', ''isn'', "''", ''t'', ''this'', ''great'',
                ''?'']`. This is the default value because it is a fast tokenizer

            description_implications:
                Choosing a tokenizer can be difficult. The primary
                thing to check is that the tokenizer you have selected is compatible
                with the language(s) in your text data. This means either selecting
                a tokenizer that is language-specific (i.e. `french_tokenize` if working
                with French text) or general enough that its tokenizations are language-agnostic
                (i.e. `space_punct`).
